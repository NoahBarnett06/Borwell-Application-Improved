# Borwell-Application-Improved
Hi, I am Noah Barnett and this is an improved version of the software challenge and part of my application to Borwell
# How to run the application
First you will need to download the zipped file of the repository and then extract all of the files. Then you just need to open the file titled 'BorwellChallenge.sln' to load the program in Visual Studios. Alternatively if only want to run the application without seeing the code in Visual Studios, you can follow the file path BorwellChallenge/bin/Debug and open the file named 'BorwellChallenge.exe'.
