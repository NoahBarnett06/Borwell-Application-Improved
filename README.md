# Borwell-Application-Improved
Hi, I am Noah Barnett and this is an improved version of the software challenge and part of my application to Borwell
# How to run the application
First you will need to download the zipped file of the repository and then extract all of the files. Then you just need to open the file titled 'BorwellChallenge.sln' to load the program in Visual Studios. Alternatively if only want to run the application without seeing the code in Visual Studios, you can follow the file path BorwellChallenge/bin/Debug and open the file named 'BorwellChallenge.exe'.
# Assumptions made
- The room is either a square or rectangluar shape
- 1 litre of paint covers 10 metres squared
# Future improvements I would make with more time
- Fix changing between forms so that only 1 form is open at a time
- Add a remove button to the doors and windows page (frmOpenings)
- Increase security in regards to passing data between the front and back ends
- Allow for other measurements rather than just metres
