windows/doors

Room class
Wall1 - decimal (length * height)
Wall2 - decimal (width * height)
Volume - decimal (width * length * height)
FloorArea - decimal (width * length)

!!! add windows & doors calculation first !!!
Paint - ??? (2(Wall1 + Wall2) /10 - round function (if Walls > Math.Round(Walls)

var ValidInput = false;

            frmDoorsAndWindows Form1 = new frmDoorsAndWindows();
            Form1.ShowDialog(); // Shows Form2
            frmDoorsAndWindows Form2 = new frmDoorsAndWindows();
            frmDoorsAndWindows Form3 = new frmDoorsAndWindows();

test public array - if top line needed - maybe put in class

window class
number
width
height

door class

single door+window class (openings?)
count = 0
width
height
ID - return count += 1
area - width * height

why did i use an array on the homepage??


Improvements
change metric from metres to anything - change calculations in class to mimic this
add testing documentation
bountry testing - super large numbers not working properly
change instruction text - not in metres, only upto ? digits and 2dp
check class, maybe use some inheritance 
future changes - way to remove doors/windows from the list
openings bigger that walls - show error msg
leaving openings page resets list but not class
change comments

main focus moving forward - more user friendly, difficult to break accidentally and produce invalid results
read me - measured in metres but other measurments work also

i made a few changes based on feedback i recieved last time 
i did testing based on the final product, since i had already completed the product
i did testing throughout development but it was all done mainly in my head and wasnt written down anywhere
